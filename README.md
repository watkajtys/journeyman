# Generative Adventure Game

This project is a submission for the Nano Banana Hackathon. It is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" (CYOA) game where every scene is dynamically generated by AI using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview) API.

## Core Concept

The game leverages the power of generative AI to create a unique and visually rich narrative experience. The story is structured as a graph in a `story.json` file, allowing for complex branching narratives, including "loop back" failure nodes inspired by interactive stories like *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*.

Each step of the adventure has a corresponding text description and a detailed image prompt. When a player makes a choice, the game sends the new prompt to the Gemini API, which generates a unique illustration for that specific moment in the story. This ensures that the visual world is built on-the-fly, directly responding to the player's decisions.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  There are no dependencies to install.
3.  Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

**Note on API Key:** The `script.js` file contains a placeholder for a Gemini API key. For the game to function, you must replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with a valid, free-tier Google AI Studio API key.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript:** The core frontend of the game. No frameworks were used to keep it lightweight and fast for the hackathon.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview):** The heart of the project. Used for all image generation.
*   **JSON:** To define the narrative structure, making the story easy to edit and expand.
